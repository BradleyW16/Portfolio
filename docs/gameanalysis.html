        <h1>Game Notes</h1>
        <p>The fact there are multiple real world obstacles and underground features allows for you to explore a post-apocalyptic world that seems like it could really happen. Where it steers off though is when you are put into this third person 2d view where we control the character from an outside perspective instead of a first-person one which would really help with the “illusion”. The settings are very simple with basic sound, camera zoom feature, and laser sight controls which allow for you to have full control over the main character you play in this world. Unfortunately this game falls short with how far you can explore since it takes place underground with walls surrounding every corner except when it comes to the secret rooms which can be explored when you go through secret bushes spread across certain walls over the different levels of the game. This kind of solo venture only allows you to interact with the enemies in one of two ways which are by killing the enemies or getting killed by them making you respawn to do the same thing again as a response. </p>
        <p>When playing this game you are challenged by not only the enemies but also the different puzzles, treasures, and other interactive materials that keep you intrigued to complete the game and its other achievements as well. This allows you to interact with objects such as different weapon types, gold, hearts that increase your health bar, bullets for your weapons, and many different types of treasure wielding items that allow for us to progress through the game correctly. But, when it comes to developing the game further I suggest new weapon types be added along with a new type of game design above ground such as a fallen/ abandoned city that way it adds to the story of the world being over run by these and more enemies and bosses that can be added in the next chapter(s) of gameplay. Overall this game was a fun shooter experience that has the potential to further explore and expand upon the world as long as the developers can keep this ball rolling which they began with this first chapter.</p>
