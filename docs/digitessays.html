        <h1>Web Development Essay</h1>
        <p>When it comes to challenges with these websites mine were definitely much more specific and special than alot of the other students in this class due to me having to use multiple machines. However, after handling these issues I have to say coding in html itself isn't so bad since it tells you specifically what to fix and where, I fell into trouble though when it came to using the terminal in order to correctly push things to Github since my system wasn't set up correctly. I also figured out later on that my files were configured all wrong which because of my need to try and "fix" it by deleting my copyed files which thanks to my digit professor I fixed quickly. The challanges I've had with wordpress is different as it is much easier to plug in the code but definitely not as easy to style and put together though as Github is since I know how to control the CSS styling more with Github more than with wordpress. When it comes to making changes on both sites I will say it is more tedious for me to do it on my Github website and more difficult on my wordpress page, this is because with Github you need to form the html, use the terminal to see the non-uploaded material, and then figure out if it pushed through on Github or not meaning you have to repeat that process again and again. It is harder however on wordpress because it already forms the styling and I personally am not as familiar with this software which makes for a hard time to actually form and yet alone design a websiteon here versus Github.</p>
        <p>When you create sites on either of these you definitely need html knowledge but that doesn't mean you need much to get going as my professor in digit says "all you need is an official starting point and a body which means you're off to the website development races" and to that I couldn't agree with more. When it comes to improving these sites though with Github researching CSS as well as html code, which can be used for both methods, using something like W3 schools will help both you and I to understand these types of structures so that we all can improve upon these incredible opportunities that we have from having this access to these web builders. When it comes to my own wishes for development on my pages I would love to figure out how to make them more desirable to not only read but look at as well by using W3 schools as well as other sites to learn html and CSS in order to acheive these goals of mine so that it looks more professional.
